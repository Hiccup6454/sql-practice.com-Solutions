1. Show patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty.
Show only the patients who has a diagnosis as 'Epilepsy' and the doctor's first name is 'Lisa'
Check patients, admissions, and doctors tables for required information.

Solution: 

Select
  p.patient_id,
  p.first_name,
  p.last_name,
  d.specialty
from patients p
  join admissions a on p.patient_id = a.patient_id
  join doctors d on a.attending_doctor_id = d.doctor_id
where
  a.diagnosis = 'Epilepsy'
  AND d.first_name = 'Lisa'

2. All patients who have gone through admissions, can see their medical documents on our site. Those patients are given a temporary password after their first admission. Show the patient_id and temp_password.

The password must be the following, in order:
1. patient_id
2. the numerical length of patient's last_name
3. year of patient's birth_date

Solution:

Select
  distinct p.patient_id,
  concat(
    p.patient_id,
    len(last_name),
    year(birth_date)
  ) as temp_password
from patients p
  join admissions a on p.patient_id = a.patient_id


3. Each admission costs $50 for patients without insurance, and $10 for patients with insurance. All patients with an even patient_id have insurance.
Give each patient a 'Yes' if they have insurance, and a 'No' if they don't have insurance. Add up the admission_total cost for each has_insurance group.

Solution:

with insurance as (
    select
      patient_id,
      Case
        when patient_id % 2 = 0 then 'Yes'
        else 'No'
      END AS has_insurance,
      case
        when patient_id % 2 = 0 then 10
        else 50
      end as cost_after_insurance
    from patients
  )
Select
  has_insurance,
  sum(cost_after_insurance) as cost_after_insurance
from insurance i
  join admissions a on i.patient_id = a.patient_id
group by has_insurance

4. Show the provinces that has more patients identified as 'M' than 'F'. Must only show full province_name

Solution:

Select province_name
From (
    Select    
      pn.province_name,
      sum(CASE when gender = 'M' then 1 else 0 end) male_count,
      sum(case when gender = 'F' then 1 else 0 end) female_count
    from patients p
      join province_names pn on p.province_id = pn.province_id
    group by
      pn.province_name
  )
 where male_count > female_count

5. We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:

  and first_name like '__r%'
  And gender = 'F'
  and month(birth_date) in (2, 5, 12)
  and weight between 60 and 80
  and patient_id in (
    select patient_id
    from patients
    where
      patient_id % 2 != 0
  )
  and city = 'Kingston'
